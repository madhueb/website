                <p>Wikipedia the largest reference work ever created, an online encylopedia where articles are written collaboratively by users and anyone can contribute. Authors can add links to other pages on Wikipedia creating ways of navigating this network of information. This has been turned into a game, Wikispeedia. The game is simple, navigate from one article to another as quickly as possible. How to do this effectivly? Hubs are articles on Wikipedia that are linked to many other articles in the Wikipedia network. This makes them access points to get from one piece of information to another. By using data over navigation paths in the Wikispeedia game, we identify which articles are hubs on Wikipedia, explore how well users navigate to hubs and the gaps in players "common knowledge".  We aim to understand which subjects are most commonly used by players and how they navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist.

			By identifying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many links) - we can analyze popular

			Let's begin with a quick introduction to the version of wikipedia in the wikispeedia game. The version containts 4604 articles, 
			each article is categoriesed as belonging to one or more topics, see figure X for the distributions of topics on Wikipedia.

			    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Number of articles belonging to each category in the Wikispeedia version of Wikipedia.</p>
			</div>
			
			We can see that the most common topics of articles are Science and Geography. The topic of an article is not neccesarily unique
			one article can belong to several topics for example Wood which belongs to both the Science category and Design and Technology.<br>
			<br>
			So, what articles are hubs are on Wikipedia and which subjects do they belong to? To start answering this question let's have a look at some data.
			For an article to be a hub it has to link to many other articles, and it is also important for the user to be able to navigate to that article, so 
			let's have a look at the number of outgoing and incoming links to articles. We refer to the number of outgoing links as the source count
			and the number of links to a specific article as the target count.

                    <p>
                        In our analysis of the Wikispeedia dataset, we previously identified key "hubs" in the network. These hubs often correspond to culturally significant anchor points, reflecting the structure of modern knowledge. However, the prominence of an article as a hub does not necessarily indicate its alignment with areas of widely shared knowledge. Instead, to better understand the common knowledge shared among users, we must delve into the paths players take during their games.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Do Players Exhibit Similar Navigation Behavior?</strong><br>
                        To identify shared knowledge, it is essential to determine whether players demonstrate consistent behaviors when faced with the same game setup (i.e., starting and target articles). If players tend to follow similar trajectories, this suggests an underlying common knowledge share by the players.<br>
                        To investigate this, we analyze how different players approach the same game ( same starting point and target) and assess the degree of similarity in the path they take to navigate.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        One way to do so is to look at the distance between paths taken by players for a given game.There are multiple ways to quantify the "distance" between paths : the Jacquard distance, shortest paths distance or a semantic distance. Each metric provides a particular perspective on the nature of the similarity. 

                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Here as an example, we display the results for finished paths of the game starting at "Calculus" and reaching "Paul McCartney", using a semantic distance based on BERT embeddings.<br>
                    </p>
            
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: center; margin-left: 20vw; margin-right: 0;">
                        <iframe src="images/heatmap_distance.html" width="100%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The heatmap shows that the paths taken by different players are quite similar,for this game the mean distance between paths is 0.21. This means that two players tend to take semtically close paths, exhibiting similar navigation behaviors. <br>
                        As we have established that users tend to follow similar patterns, we can now further explore their navigation habits.
            
                    <p>
                        <strong>What do the players' paths teach us about common knowledge?</strong><br>
                        
                        To analyze players' navigation habits, key questions arise: which articles are visited most often? Which categories are explored? What links are clicked on the most? Since players tend to select articles they are familiar with or knowledgeable about to reach their target, examining these choices offers valuable insights into shared knowledge.<br>

                        To address this, we identify the top 10 most visited articles, the most frequently clicked links, and the frequency of exploration for each category across all games.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/top_10_articles.html" width="100%%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most visited articles align closely with the network’s major hubs, representing globally recognized topics. This suggests that players have a good knowledge of these concepts and their connections. Notably, only four categories are represented in the top 10, indicating areas where players feel most confident and knowledgeable.
                    </p>

                    
                    

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/top_10_links_visites.html" width="80%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most clicked links highlight common associations widely understood by players. As with the most visited articles, these associations are predominantly related to geography and science.
                        This reveals taxonomies that are commonly understood and recognized, such as biodiversity taxonomy (e.g., mammals being animals) and geographic taxonomy (e.g., the UK being part of Europe). These patterns reflect a shared understanding of fundamental classifications that guide players' navigation choices.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <iframe src="images/wordcloud_categories.png" width="80%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The word cloud above illustrates the frequency of exploration for each category across all games, with the size of each category corresponding to the number of visits it received. Consistent with earlier findings, the most frequently visited categories are Science, Geography, Countries, and History, reflecting players' stronger knowledge in these areas. In contrast, less explored categories, such as Mathematics or Art, may indicate areas where players have comparatively less familiarity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To better understand whether players have knowledge of a particular category, it is useful to examine the success rate of games starting from a given category and reaching a target category. This can reveal how confident players are when navigating between different topics.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/success_rate_heatmap.html" width="80%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The heatmap above illustrates players' confidence in navigating between different categories. Missing success rates occur due to insufficient data, with too few games played between certain category pairs. The heatmap confirms that players have strong knowledge of countries and geography, as indicated by higher success rates for games targeting articles related to these topics. Surprisingly, we also observe high success rates for certain category pairs, such as IT to Music or Mathematics to People. Additionally, games targeting Religion articles tend to show higher success rates, suggesting new common associations within players' knowledge.<br>
                        These analyses offer valuable insights into players' shared knowledge, but it is also interesting to ask ourselves what players commonly do not know.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <strong>What can we learn from unfinished paths?</strong><br>
                        Analyzing successful paths offers valuable insights into shared knowledge, but studying unfinished paths can also uncover crucial information about knowledge gaps. By understanding where players stop and how close they are to the target, we can identify areas where their knowledge is lacking. For instance, players who stop near the target but without a strong semantic connection may not recognize the link between the two points, highlighting a gap in their knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following plots, we illustrate how close users were to the target, both in terms of semantic distance and the number of clicks away.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/dist_to_target.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>
            
                    <p>
                        As the plots demonstrate, some unfinished games stop very close to the target—either just one click away or semantically close—indicating that players may have thought they had reached the target. However, other games, still fairly close to the end (two or three clicks away), but not semantically close, suggest a potential knowledge gap. In these cases, players may fail to identify the connection between their stopping point and the target.<br>
                        One example from the data involves the target "Milk," where the player stops at "Louis Pasteur," just two clicks away (Louis Pasteur → pasteurization → milk). This suggests that the player may not be aware of the connection between pasteurization and milk.                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        We can further analyze these unfinished games where players are two clicks away from the target by examining the categories of their stopping points and the target categories. To identify patterns in knowledge gaps, we define a "commonly unknown connection" as one where at least 10 players stopped at the same point while attempting to reach the same target. The following plot highlights these commonly unknown connections and the categories they involve.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/sankey.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The Sankey diagram above visualizes these unknown connections. Interestingly, it includes some categories previously identified as "well-known," such as Science and Geography. This suggests that while players generally possess more knowledge in these areas, they still lack understanding of certain specific topics within these categories. As expected, the diagram also features categories previously labeled as less familiar, such as Everyday Life and Design and Technology.
                    </p>

                        In conclusion, the paths taken by players provide valuable insights into common knowledge: they reveal the categories where players have the most familiarity, the links and associations they commonly understand, as well as the connections they often fail to recognize. These findings help us better understand the collective knowledge landscape of the players.  <br>

                        However, it is essential to interpret these results with caution, as they are heavily influenced by the types of games played. The starting and target categories significantly impact the patterns observed, and an unequal distribution of game types could skew the conclusions. Future analyses should aim to account for this bias to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of shared and missing knowledge.
