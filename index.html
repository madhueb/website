                <p>Wikipedia, the largest reference work ever created, is an online encyclopedia where anyone can 
                    contribute collaboratively written articles. Its interconnected structure makes it an ideal platform 
                    to study navigation and human associations through games like Wikispeedia 
                    (play <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/">here</a>). In this game, players navigate
                    from one article to another using only hyperlinks, aiming to minimize the number of clicks. This project
                    explores two central themes: the role of hubs—highly connected articles—and user navigation patterns.
                    By analyzing the characteristics and usage of hubs, common and abandoned paths, and more,
                    we provide insights into how Wikipedia’s structure influences player strategies and efficiency.
                    Our findings aim to learn something about common knowledge, user patterns, and the interplay between 
                    structure and strategy.

		Our project uses Wikispeedia to explore the structure and gaps in our society's "common knowledge" 
			by analyzing both popular articles and hub articles. We aim to understand which subjects are 
			most commonly recognized, how players navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist. 
			By identifying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many links) - we can analyze popular 
			knowledge compared to specialized knowledge. Additionally, exploring common links in successful paths 
			with unfinished paths will further help us understand public knowledge gaps. Finally, we compare hubs and 
			user navigation patterns to determine whether hubs improve path efficiency or if users bypass them in favor 
			of more accessible articles. Through these analyses, we hope to reveal insights into shared knowledge, 
			intuitive navigation patterns, and the cultural biases embedded in these patterns.</p> -->

			Let's begin with a quick introduction to the version of Wikipedia in the Wikispeedia game. The version containts 4604 articles and 
			if it is possible to navigate from one article to another the target article is maximum 9 clicks away. That means from one article to any 
			other which it is possible to navigate to 9 is the maximum number of clicks you might have to do to reach the target article. 
			Each article is categoriesed as belonging to one or more topics. The figure below shows the distributions of categories on Wikipedia. 
			The category of an article is not neccesarily unique as one article can belong to several topics for example Wood which belongs to both 
			the Science and Design and Technology. We can see that the most common categories of articles are Science and Geography. </p>

			<h3 class="subsection-title">Hubs</h3>
			<p>
			To start defining hubs, let's have a look at some data.
			For an article to be a hub it has to shorten the distance between articles in the wikipedia network, therefore
			it is important that it links to many articles and has many links to it. So, let's have a look at the number 
			of outgoing and incoming links to articles. We refer to the number of outgoing links as the source count
			and the number of links to a specific article as the target count.
			</p>

			<IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/combined_histograms_links.png"ALIGN=”center” />
			<p>
			From the plot we can see that there is an uneaven distribution of the number of links to and from articles. Most articles have very few links 
			to them and some articles have a lot of links to them. 
			Hubs not only have to have many links to or from one article to others. They must also be well connected in the network to be able to navigate 
			from one piece of information to another. How interconnected are the Wikipedia articles? To explore this data over the shortest path from one article 
			to another is used and remeber the maximum path length is 9 if you are able to access an article. The histogram shows the mean shortest path from articles to any other articles 
			for which it is possible to navigate to.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <img src="images/hubs_images/mean_shortest_path_hist.png" alt="Histogram of shortest path">
                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			For this plot some articles have a very low value however this is because they are only connected to a few articles. (SHOULD I FILTER OUT THESE?) 
			The table below shows statistics for the source count, target count, and mean shortest path from an article to all articles it is connected to.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/table_stats.png"ALIGN=”center” width="500" height="150" />
                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			From the statistics we can see that there are articles with no links from them this makes them dead ends. There are also articles with no links to them,
			this means unless a player starts in this article they are unaccessible to the player. We can also see clearly that the distribution of number of links
			on articles is more even, than the number of links to articles. This means that there are articles which are much more accessible to players than others.
			So how to define a hub? To help us do this we decided on using the PageRank algorithm. This gives a continuous measure from 0 to 1 of how important an article is by looking
			at the number of links to that article and the quality of the link. The "quality" of the link refers to how many incoming edges that node (article) has. 
           		Therefore, PageRank is an iterative algorithm to rank nodes in a graph network.  <br><br>

           		However, the traditional PageRank algorithm highly prioritizes incoming edges to a node, with little consideration given to number of outgoing edges. 
            		For our purposes, we need to consider both target and source count, to understand articles that are truly cornerstones within the Wikispeedia game. 
            		We therefore adjusted the PageRank algorithm to give equal weighting to nodes with a high number of incoming edges and nodes with a higher number of outoing edges.
            		The 'PageRank' value you will see in all charts below refers to this metric we created. The histogram
			below shows the top 10 hubs using this metric. USA is the largest hub on Wikispeedia. <br>

                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			As a sanity check let's see how well our metric captures the caracteristics of a hub previously described. To do this
			we look at the correlation between the variables Source Count, Target Count, Mean shortest path to articles from article
			and the PageRank score.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/corr_figure.png"ALIGN=”center” width="900" height="300" />
                    	</div>

			<p>
			From the correlation matrix we see that the page rank score is correlated with both the target count and the source count.
			It is negatively correlated with the mean shortest path to the article and to other articles from a given article.
			This means that the higher the page rank score the lower is the mean shortest path.
			All correlations are significant using a p-value < 0.01. 
			This tells us the pagerank score captures the characteristics of a hub well!
			Now that we have created a metric for the hubs on wikipedia what categories have the highest pagerank score?
			</p>

                    	</div>


                    <p> 
                    Here we have visualized all the articles in the graph network in space, with each dot representing an article, 
                    and the size of the dot being correlated to the value of the PageRank score. From this, we can get an idea of 
                    just how large the network is, and how there are not many articles with notable PageRank values, meaning they
                    are not very well connected in the network.

                    <h3 class="subsection-title">User Navigation Pattern</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        In our analysis of the Wikispeedia dataset, we previously identified key "hubs" in the network. 
			These hubs often correspond to culturally significant anchor points, reflecting the structure of modern knowledge. 
			    However, the prominence of an article as a hub does not necessarily indicate its alignment with areas of widely shared knowledge. 
			    Instead, to better understand the common knowledge shared among users, we must delve into the paths players take during their games.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Do Players Exhibit Similar Navigation Behavior?</strong><br>
                        To identify shared knowledge, it is essential to determine whether players demonstrate consistent behaviors when faced with the same game setup (i.e., starting and target articles). If players tend to follow similar trajectories, this suggests an underlying common knowledge share by the players.<br>
                        To investigate this, we analyze how different players approach the same game ( same starting point and target) and assess the degree of similarity in the path they take to navigate.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        One way to do so is to look at the distance between paths taken by players for a given game. 
			    There are multiple ways to quantify the "distance" between paths : the Jacquard distance, shortest paths distance or a semantic distance. 
			    Each metric provides a particular perspective on the nature of the similarity. 

                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Here, as an example, we present the results for completed paths in the game that start at "Calculus" and end at "Paul McCartney". 
			    This distance is the cosine distance, ranging from 0 to 2,between the embeddings of two different paths, calculated using a pretrained 
			    BERT model. It represents how semantically close two paths are. <br>
                    </p>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/heatmap_distance.html" width="90%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                        <iframe src="images/mean_sim_distrib.html" width="90%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    	<p>
			The heatmap reveals that the paths taken by different players are highly similar, with a mean semantic distance of 0.21 
			for this specific game. As the histogram demonstrates, this pattern holds true across all completed games in our dataset, 
			showing a global mean distance of 0.15 between two finished paths for the same game. For comparison, we calculated the mean distance 
			between two random paths (based on 100 randomly generated paths), which is significantly higher at 0.87. This indicates that players 
			tend to follow semantically close paths, reflecting similar navigation behaviors.                        
			As we have established that users tend to follow similar patterns, we can now further explore their navigation habits.
			</p>
            
                    	<p>
                        <strong>What do the players' paths teach us about common knowledge?</strong><br>
                        To analyze players' navigation habits, key questions arise: which articles are visited most often? 
			Which categories are explored? What links are clicked on the most? Since players tend to select articles they are 
			familiar with or knowledgeable about to reach their target, examining these choices offers valuable insights into shared 
			knowledge.
			<br>
                        To address this, we identify the top 10 most visited articles, the most frequently clicked links, and the frequency of 
			exploration for each category across all games.
                    	</p>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most visited articles align closely with the network’s major hubs, representing globally recognized topics. 
			This suggests that players have a good knowledge of these concepts and their connections. Notably, only four categories are 
			represented in the top 10, indicating areas where players feel most confident and knowledgeable.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most clicked links highlight common associations widely understood by players. As with the most visited articles, these associations are predominantly related to geography and science.
                        This reveals taxonomies that are commonly understood and recognized, such as biodiversity taxonomy (e.g., mammals being animals) and geographic taxonomy (e.g., the UK being part of Europe). These patterns reflect a shared understanding of fundamental classifications that guide players' navigation choices.

                        The word cloud above visualizes the frequency of exploration for each category across all games, with the size of each category proportional to the number of visits it received, normalized by the number of articles within that category. Consistent with earlier observations, the most frequently explored categories are Science, Geography, Countries, and History, highlighting players' stronger knowledge in these domains.Additionally, Everyday Life appears to be another category that players tend to visit more often. In contrast, less visited categories like Mathematics or Art may point to areas where players might have comparatively less familiarity.  </p>

                    <p>
                        To better understand whether players have knowledge of a particular category, it is useful to examine the success rate of games starting from a given category and reaching a target category. This can reveal how confident players are when navigating between different topics.

                    <p>
                        The heatmap above illustrates players' confidence in navigating between different categories. Missing success rates occur due to insufficient data, with too few games played between certain category pairs. The heatmap confirms that players have strong knowledge of countries and geography, as indicated by higher success rates for games targeting articles related to these topics. Surprisingly, we also observe high success rates for certain category pairs, such as IT to Music or Mathematics to People. Additionally, games targeting Religion articles tend to show higher success rates, suggesting new common associations within players' knowledge.<br>
                        These analyses offer valuable insights into players' shared knowledge, but it is also interesting to ask ourselves what players commonly do not know.

                        <strong>What can we learn from unfinished paths?</strong><br>
                        Analyzing successful paths offers valuable insights into shared knowledge, but studying unfinished paths can also uncover crucial information about knowledge gaps. By understanding where players stop and how close they are to the target, we can identify areas where their knowledge is lacking. For instance, players who stop near the target but without a strong semantic connection may not recognize the link between the two points, highlighting a gap in their knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following plots, we illustrate how close users were to the target, both in terms of semantic distance and the number of clicks away.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/dist_to_target.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>
            
                    <p>
                        As the plots demonstrate, some unfinished games stop very close to the target—either just one click away or semantically close—indicating that players may have thought they had reached the target. However, other games, still fairly close to the end (two or three clicks away), but not semantically close, suggest a potential knowledge gap. In these cases, players may fail to identify the connection between their stopping point and the target.<br>
                        One example from the data involves the target "Milk," where the player stops at "Louis Pasteur," just two clicks away (Louis Pasteur → pasteurization → milk). This suggests that the player may not be aware of the connection between pasteurization and milk.                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        We can further analyze these unfinished games where players are two clicks away from the target by examining the categories of their stopping points and the target categories. To identify patterns in knowledge gaps, we define a "commonly unknown connection" as one where at least 10 players stopped at the same point while attempting to reach the same target. The following plot highlights these commonly unknown connections and the categories they involve.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/sankey.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The Sankey diagram above visualizes these unknown connections. Interestingly, it includes some categories previously identified as "well-known," such as Science and Geography. This suggests that while players generally possess more knowledge in these areas, they still lack understanding of certain specific topics within these categories. As expected, the diagram also features categories previously labeled as less familiar, such as Everyday Life and Design and Technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the paths taken by players provide valuable insights into common knowledge: they reveal the categories where players have the most familiarity, the links and associations they commonly understand, as well as the connections they often fail to recognize. These findings help us better understand the collective knowledge landscape of the players.  <br>

                        However, it is essential to interpret these results with caution, as they are heavily influenced by the types of games played. The starting and target categories significantly impact the patterns observed, and an unequal distribution of game types could skew the conclusions. Future analyses should aim to account for this bias to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of shared and missing knowledge.

                    <p>
                        In the next figure and the three following it we plot an articles pagerank score against the
                        total amount of clicks it has recieved by the players. The frequency has been normalised by 
                        the percentage of articles that has a link to the article in question. This is done to mitigate the 
                        fact that the amount of clicks also depends on the amount of times players stumble upon a link 
                        to that article. In addition, to make it easier to detect outliers, a line is plotted at the 
                        mean of both axises. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to the fact that most categories are spread out across all quadrants the 
                        categories of biggest interest are those that tend to a certain quadrant or have more big 
                        outliers than the other ones. The quadrants of interest are the upper left and the lower 
                        right quadrants. The first one contains articles that on average is lesser connected yet 
                        still highly selected by the players with respect to how often they appear. With the 
                        assumption that people in general tend to click more on articles that they know things about, 
                        these articles might constitute common knowledge more than other articles. The opposite can 
                        be said about the lower right quadrant, which therefore contains articles that might 
                        constitute lesser known concepts. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, since this is a game with better and worse strategies of which articles to go through, that 
                        the players also are aware of, it is important to not focus on specific articles but instead 
                        of what category of articles that stands out.

                        Observations <br>

                        - Geography is a scattered category that constitutes a large part of the biggest hubs and 
                        most frequently used articles by users. However, they also constitute the majority of the 
                        more connected articles that does not get used. More specifically, it seems like it is 
                        primarily contries that belong to this group, which differs from geography in the sense 
                        that the category is very shifted towards the lower right quadrant. Someething that is 
                        investigated in the next plot. <br>
                        - Science is also very scatterd, with a lot of big outliers in both the upper left and 
                        lower right quadrants. <br>
                        - Everyday life and IT seems to have some articles that are used more than average by users,
                        yet still on average is less connected than other articles. IT is particularly interesting 
                        since its articles are heavily shifted up to the left, with 0 articles in the lower right 
                        quadrant. <br>

                        Observations <br>
                        - The categories that have tends towards the upper left quadrant with bigger portion of 
                        outliers than other articles are North American Geography, General Geograhpy and Geology 
                        and Geophysics. <br>
                        - As stated before and can be seen in the first plot, countries constitute the absolute 
                        majority of all articles in the lower right quadrant. <br>

                        Observation <br>
                        - The majority of articles with a smaller pagerank score that yet have above average 
                        frequency by users belong to the "Film" and "Computer and Video games" categories. 
                        Where the articles in question are big popcultural phenomenon such as Star Wars, Nintendo 
                        and Mario. Something that is not that suprising that people have good knowledge in. <br>
                        - Sports constitutes the biggest part of the articles in "Everyday life" that are in the 
                        lower right quadrant. <br>

                        - Chemistry has almost no articles in the upper left quadrant but a lot in the lower right 
                        one. <br>
                        - Physics is heavily scattered. The artiles in the upper left quadrant are almost all space 
                        related, while the ones in the lower right quadrant are more low-level physics. <br>
                        - Biology is also scattered, where animals mostly make up the articles in the upper left 
                        quadrant while more low level articles constitute the articles in the lower right column. <br>

                    <p>
                        In this plot we gathered external data on the average amount of views on wikipedia <br>
                        per month over the last 1o years for all articles. This was then used to calculate <br>
                        the average views for the articles in each quadrant. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It can be seen that the articles in the lower right quadrant has significally higher <br>
                        views on average than the articles in the upper left. This goes in line with the <br>
                        assumptions made on the 2 quadrants for the 4 plots above, since information looked <br>
                        up on wikipedia is usually not known to the user beforehand. Therefore, the claim <br>
                        that the articles in the upper left quadrant might constitute common knowledge more <br>
                        than the articles in the lower right quadrant is supported (but not proven) by the <br>
                        fact that the articles in the lower right quadrants have more than twice as many <br>
                        visits per month as the articles in the upper left quadrant.

                        Another approach to understanding user navigation patterns is to examine how
                        often players choose to bypass a more central article in favor of a less optimal one, 
                        by comparing their hubness score. 
                        We investigate cases where alternative choices have the same or 
                        shorter shortest-path distance to the target, in order to reveal which articles are 
                        frequently overlooked by players.

                        to the number of times it was bypassed. This analysis helps identify articles that 
                        are consistently neglected by players, potentially indicating a lower level of

                        As expected, users frequently deviate 
                        from the most central navigation path. A remarkable 41.9% of choices are optimal in this context.
                        Notably, some articles are overlooked more frequently 
                        than others, suggesting that users are less likely to consider these articles during 
                        navigation. Specifically, articles such as "Thomas Edison", "Nikola Tesla" and "Lyme Disease" 
                        appear to be consistently neglected, potentially indicating a lower level of awareness 
                        or recognition of these topics among players.

                        This plot shows that, the more central an article is the more predictable 
                        is the rate at which it is ignored despite leading to the target quicker/ equally quickly 
                        and with a higher hub score. This may be due to a higher occurance rate of 
                        'hublike' articles. Nevertheless, while exploring the plot some peculiarities can be observed. 
                        Some oddly specific articles are ignored a lot less than the majority, despite a similar hub score. 
                        This could result from users being more aware of e. g. chemical elements, 
                        than 'Lyme disease'. The article 'Lyme disease' is ignored 59% of the time, which is
                        almost double compared to the article 'Rodium', despite a comparable hub score. 
                        Notably most of the articles that are rarely forgone (below 5%) belong to the category Science.
                        The second most present category in that group is Geography.
                        This group of rarely forgone articles may be associated with general knowledge or widely studied topics. 
                        they are more likely to be chosen during navigation. In contrast, more niche or 
                        specialized articles, like those related to diseases or obscure topics, are often 
                        overlooked, even when they provide efficient paths. </br>

                        When analyzing the usage of hubs along navigation paths, it becomes clear that top 
                        hubs are used more frequently at the beginning of a path and less often as users 
                        approach their target. In 57% of puzzles, the optimal strategy involves clicking 
                        one of the top 10% most connected hubs on the first move. Most players inherently 
                        use these hubs more than that in their initial steps.
                        Notably, successful players use top hubs within 
                        their first three steps more frequently than unsuccessful players, however, 
                        this correlation does not allow for causation. It merely visualizes the overall navigation

                        In conclusion, the analysis of hubs and user navigation patterns provides indications
                        of 
                        shared knowledge and common navigation behaviors. By examining the paths players take, 
                        the articles they visit most frequently, and the categories they explore, we gain a deeper 
                        understanding of the collective knowledge landscape. Additionally, the investigation of 
                        bypassed articles provides insights into the choices players make during navigation, 
                        highlighting topics that are consistently overlooked. These findings offer valuable 
                        insights into the common knowledge shared by players and the navigation strategies they employ. -->
