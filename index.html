                <p>Wikipedia the largest reference work ever created, an online encylopedia where articles are written collaboratively by users and anyone can contribute. Authors can add links to other pages on Wikipedia creating ways of navigating this network of information. This has been turned into a game, Wikispeedia. The game is simple, navigate from one article to another as quickly as possible. How to do this effectivly? Hubs are articles on Wikipedia that are linked to many other articles in the Wikipedia network. This makes them access points to get from one piece of information to another. By using data over navigation paths in the Wikispeedia game, we identify which articles are hubs on Wikipedia, explore how well users navigate to hubs and the gaps in players "common knowledge".  We aim to understand which subjects are most commonly used by players and how they navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist.

			By identifying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many links) - we can analyze popular

			Each article is categoriesed as belonging to one or more topics. The figure below shows the distributions of topics on Wikipedia. 
			The topic of an article is not neccesarily unique one article can belong to several topics for example Wood which belongs to both

			<h3 class="subsection-title">Hubs</h3>
			So, what articles are hubs are on Wikipedia? To answer this question let's have a look at some data.
			For an article to be a hub it has to link to many other articles, and it is also important for the user to be able to navigate to that article, so 
			let's have a look at the number of outgoing and incoming links to articles. We refer to the number of outgoing links as the source count
			and the number of links to a specific article as the target count.

			<IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/combined_histograms.png"ALIGN=”center” />

			From the plot we can see that there is an uneaven distribution of the number of links to and from articles. Most articles have very few links 
			to them and some articles have a lot of links to them. Here are some statistics:

			<table>
			    <thead>
			        <tr>
			            <th> </th> <th> Source Count </th> <th> Target Count </th>
			        </tr>
			    </thead>
			    <tbody>
			        <tr> <td> Min </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> </tr>
			        <tr> <td> Median </td> <td> 19 </td> <td> 8 </td> </tr>
			        <tr> <td> Max </td> <td> 294 </td> <td> 1551 </td> </tr>
			        <tr> <td> Mean </td> <td> 26.0 </td> <td> 26.0 </td> </tr>
			    </tbody>
			</table>
			
			Hubs not only have to have many links to or from one article to others. They must also be well connected in the network to be able to navigate 
			from one piece of information to another. How interconnected are the Wikipedia articles? To explore this data over the shortest path from one article 
			to another is used and remeber the maximum path length is 9 if you are able to access an article. The histogram shows the mean shortest path from articles to any other articles 
			for which it is possible to navigate to. <br><br>

			For this plot some articles have a very low value however this is because they are only connected to a few articles. (SHOULD I FILTER OUT THESE)

                    <p>
                        In our analysis of the Wikispeedia dataset, we previously identified key "hubs" in the network. These hubs often correspond to culturally significant anchor points, reflecting the structure of modern knowledge. However, the prominence of an article as a hub does not necessarily indicate its alignment with areas of widely shared knowledge. Instead, to better understand the common knowledge shared among users, we must delve into the paths players take during their games.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Do Players Exhibit Similar Navigation Behavior?</strong><br>
                        To identify shared knowledge, it is essential to determine whether players demonstrate consistent behaviors when faced with the same game setup (i.e., starting and target articles). If players tend to follow similar trajectories, this suggests an underlying common knowledge share by the players.<br>
                        To investigate this, we analyze how different players approach the same game ( same starting point and target) and assess the degree of similarity in the path they take to navigate.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        One way to do so is to look at the distance between paths taken by players for a given game. There are multiple ways to quantify the "distance" between paths : the Jacquard distance, shortest paths distance or a semantic distance. Each metric provides a particular perspective on the nature of the similarity. 

                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Here, as an example, we present the results for completed paths in the game that start at "Calculus" and end at "Paul McCartney". This distance is the cosine distance, ranging from 0 to 2,between the embeddings of two different paths, calculated using a pretrained BERT model. It represents how semantically close two paths are. <br>
                    </p>
            
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/heatmap_distance.html" width="100%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                        <iframe src="images/mean_sim_distrib.html" width="80%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>

                        The heatmap reveals that the paths taken by different players are highly similar, with a mean semantic distance of 0.21 for this specific game. As the histogram demonstrates, this pattern holds true across all completed games in our dataset, showing a global mean distance of 0.15 between two finished paths for the same game. For comparison, we calculated the mean distance between two random paths (based on 100 randomly generated paths), which is significantly higher at 0.87. This indicates that players tend to follow semantically close paths, reflecting similar navigation behaviors.                        As we have established that users tend to follow similar patterns, we can now further explore their navigation habits.
            
                    <p>
                        <strong>What do the players' paths teach us about common knowledge?</strong><br>
                        
                        To analyze players' navigation habits, key questions arise: which articles are visited most often? Which categories are explored? What links are clicked on the most? Since players tend to select articles they are familiar with or knowledgeable about to reach their target, examining these choices offers valuable insights into shared knowledge.<br>

                        To address this, we identify the top 10 most visited articles, the most frequently clicked links, and the frequency of exploration for each category across all games.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/top_10_articles.html" width="100%%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most visited articles align closely with the network’s major hubs, representing globally recognized topics. This suggests that players have a good knowledge of these concepts and their connections. Notably, only four categories are represented in the top 10, indicating areas where players feel most confident and knowledgeable.
                    </p>

                    
                    

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/top_10_links_visites.html" width="80%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most clicked links highlight common associations widely understood by players. As with the most visited articles, these associations are predominantly related to geography and science.
                        This reveals taxonomies that are commonly understood and recognized, such as biodiversity taxonomy (e.g., mammals being animals) and geographic taxonomy (e.g., the UK being part of Europe). These patterns reflect a shared understanding of fundamental classifications that guide players' navigation choices.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <iframe src="images/wordcloud_categories.png" width="80%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The word cloud above visualizes the frequency of exploration for each category across all games, with the size of each category proportional to the number of visits it received, normalized by the number of articles within that category. Consistent with earlier observations, the most frequently explored categories are Science, Geography, Countries, and History, highlighting players' stronger knowledge in these domains.Additionally, Everyday Life appears to be another category that players tend to visit more often. In contrast, less visited categories like Mathematics or Art may point to areas where players might have comparatively less familiarity.  </p>

                    <p>
                        To better understand whether players have knowledge of a particular category, it is useful to examine the success rate of games starting from a given category and reaching a target category. This can reveal how confident players are when navigating between different topics.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/success_rate_heatmap.html" width="80%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The heatmap above illustrates players' confidence in navigating between different categories. Missing success rates occur due to insufficient data, with too few games played between certain category pairs. The heatmap confirms that players have strong knowledge of countries and geography, as indicated by higher success rates for games targeting articles related to these topics. Surprisingly, we also observe high success rates for certain category pairs, such as IT to Music or Mathematics to People. Additionally, games targeting Religion articles tend to show higher success rates, suggesting new common associations within players' knowledge.<br>
                        These analyses offer valuable insights into players' shared knowledge, but it is also interesting to ask ourselves what players commonly do not know.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                        <strong>What can we learn from unfinished paths?</strong><br>
                        Analyzing successful paths offers valuable insights into shared knowledge, but studying unfinished paths can also uncover crucial information about knowledge gaps. By understanding where players stop and how close they are to the target, we can identify areas where their knowledge is lacking. For instance, players who stop near the target but without a strong semantic connection may not recognize the link between the two points, highlighting a gap in their knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following plots, we illustrate how close users were to the target, both in terms of semantic distance and the number of clicks away.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/dist_to_target.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>
            
                    <p>
                        As the plots demonstrate, some unfinished games stop very close to the target—either just one click away or semantically close—indicating that players may have thought they had reached the target. However, other games, still fairly close to the end (two or three clicks away), but not semantically close, suggest a potential knowledge gap. In these cases, players may fail to identify the connection between their stopping point and the target.<br>
                        One example from the data involves the target "Milk," where the player stops at "Louis Pasteur," just two clicks away (Louis Pasteur → pasteurization → milk). This suggests that the player may not be aware of the connection between pasteurization and milk.                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        We can further analyze these unfinished games where players are two clicks away from the target by examining the categories of their stopping points and the target categories. To identify patterns in knowledge gaps, we define a "commonly unknown connection" as one where at least 10 players stopped at the same point while attempting to reach the same target. The following plot highlights these commonly unknown connections and the categories they involve.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/sankey.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The Sankey diagram above visualizes these unknown connections. Interestingly, it includes some categories previously identified as "well-known," such as Science and Geography. This suggests that while players generally possess more knowledge in these areas, they still lack understanding of certain specific topics within these categories. As expected, the diagram also features categories previously labeled as less familiar, such as Everyday Life and Design and Technology.

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the paths taken by players provide valuable insights into common knowledge: they reveal the categories where players have the most familiarity, the links and associations they commonly understand, as well as the connections they often fail to recognize. These findings help us better understand the collective knowledge landscape of the players.  <br>

                        However, it is essential to interpret these results with caution, as they are heavily influenced by the types of games played. The starting and target categories significantly impact the patterns observed, and an unequal distribution of game types could skew the conclusions. Future analyses should aim to account for this bias to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of shared and missing knowledge.

                        Observations<br>

                        -   Even though geography and contries constitute the majority of the biggest hubs and frequently used articles by users, they also constitute the majority of the more connected articles that does not get used. More specifically, it seems like it is primarily contries that belong to this group. Someething that is investigated in the next plot. <br>
                        - Everyday life and IT seems to have some articles that are used more than average by users, yet still on average is less connected than other articles.  <br>
                    </p>


                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        - The majority of the articles that may indicate lack of common knowledge are contries in Asia, Africa and Europe. These are however mainly smaller countries (with some larger cities also featuring), whilst the larger ones tends to be used more frequently. <br>
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                    </div>

                    <p>
                    - The majority of articles with a smaller pagerank score that yet have above average frequency by users belong to the "Film" and "Computer and Video games" categories. Where the articles in question are big popcultural phenomenon such as Star Wars, Nintendo and Mario. Something that is not that suprising that people have good knowledge in.
