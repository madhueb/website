                <p>Wikipedia, the largest reference work ever created, is an online encyclopedia where anyone can 
                    contribute to collaboratively written articles. Its interconnected structure makes it an ideal platform 
                    to study navigation and human associations through games like Wikispeedia 
                    (play <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/">here</a>). In this game, players navigate
                    from one article to another using only hyperlinks, aiming to minimize the number of clicks. This project
                    explores two central themes: the role of hubs—highly connected articles—and user navigation patterns.
                    By analyzing the characteristics and usage of hubs, common and abandoned paths, and more,
                    we provide insights into how Wikipedia’s structure influences player strategies and efficiency.
                    Our findings aim to learn something about common knowledge, user patterns, and the interplay between 
                    structure and strategy.

		Our project uses Wikispeedia to explore the structure and gaps in our society's "common knowledge" 
			by analyzing both popular articles and hub articles. We aim to understand which subjects are 
			most commonly recognized, how players navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist. 
			By identifying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many links) - we can analyze popular 
			knowledge compared to specialized knowledge. Additionally, exploring common links in successful paths 
			with unfinished paths will further help us understand public knowledge gaps. Finally, we compare hubs and 
			user navigation patterns to determine whether hubs improve path efficiency or if users bypass them in favor 
			of more accessible articles. Through these analyses, we hope to reveal insights into shared knowledge, 
			intuitive navigation patterns, and the cultural biases embedded in these patterns.</p> -->

			Let's begin with a quick introduction to the version of Wikipedia in the Wikispeedia game. The version containts 4604 articles and 
			if it is possible to navigate from one article to another the target article is maximum 9 clicks away. That means from one article to any 
			other which it is possible to navigate to 9 is the maximum number of clicks you might have to do to reach the target article. 
			Each article is categoriesed as belonging to one or more topics. The figure below shows the distributions of categories on Wikipedia. 
			The category of an article is not neccesarily unique as one article can belong to several topics for example Wood which belongs to both 
			the Science and Design and Technology. We can see that the most common categories of articles are Science and Geography. </p>

			<h3 class="subsection-title">Hubs</h3>
			<p>
			To start defining hubs, let's have a look at some data.
			For an article to be a hub it has to shorten the distance between articles in the wikipedia network, therefore
			it is important that it links to many articles and has many links to it. So, let's have a look at the number 
			of outgoing and incoming links to articles. We refer to the number of outgoing links as the source count
			and the number of links to a specific article as the target count.
			</p>

			<IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/combined_histogramstarget_counts.png"ALIGN=”center” />
			<p>
			From the plot we can see that there is an uneaven distribution of the number of links to and from articles. Most articles have very few links 
			to them and some articles have a lot of links to them. The number of links on Wikipedia pages falls within a smaller range of values. This is means that the 
			number of outgoing links from each Wikipedia article is more limited, while many articles tend to link to the same more central articles.
			Hubs not only have to have many links to or from them. For an article to be a hub it is also important to be able to navigate to other articles effectivly, 
			thus they must be well connected within the network. To explore how interconnected an article is data over the shortest paths in the wikipedia network is used.
			Remeber the maximum path distance is 9 if you are able to access an article from another. The histogram below illustrates the mean shortest path from articles to any other 
			articles that can be navigated to. Additionally, it shows the distribution of the mean shortest path leading to each article.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <img src="images/hubs_images/combined_histogramsmean_shortest_path.png" alt="Histogram of shortest path">
                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			In the first plot we see that the distribution of mean shortest path to another article is much more evenly distributed and dense. 
			We can see that there are some articles which are outliers and have a very short mean shortest path. However, this does not mean that 
			they are more connected to other articles in the network since nan mean was used to calculate the mean shortest path. 
			Therefore articles which are not connected to any other article will have a value close to 0.

			The mean shortest path to a article is less dense and we can see that there are also some outliers. We can see that some articles 
			have the value 0 for mean shortest path to them meaning these articles are in accessible to players unless they start from this 
			article. 
			The table below shows statistics for the variables source count, target count, mean shortest path from articles to articles it is connected to and
			the mean shortest path leading to each article.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <IMG SRC="images/table_hubs_stats.png"ALIGN=”center” width="500" height="150" />
                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			From the statistics we can see that there are articles with no links from them this makes them dead ends in the Wikispeedia game. 
			There are also articles with no links to them,
			this means unless a player starts in this article they are unaccessible to the player. We can also see clearly that the distribution of number of links
			on articles is more even, than the number of links to articles. This means that there are articles which are much more accessible to players than others.
			So how to define a hub? To help us do this we decided on using the PageRank algorithm. This gives a continuous measure from 0 to 1 of how important an article is by looking
			at the number of links to that article and the quality of the link. The "quality" of the link refers to how many incoming edges that node (article) has. 
           		Therefore, PageRank is an iterative algorithm to rank nodes in a graph network.  <br><br>

           		However, the traditional PageRank algorithm highly prioritizes incoming edges to a node, with little consideration given to number of outgoing edges. 
            		For our purposes, we need to consider both target and source count, to understand articles that are truly cornerstones within the Wikispeedia game. 
            		We therefore adjusted the PageRank algorithm to give equal weighting to nodes with a high number of incoming edges and nodes with a higher number of outoing edges.
            		The 'PageRank' value you will see in all charts below refers to this metric we created. The histogram
			below shows the top 10 hubs using this metric. USA is the largest hub on Wikispeedia. <br>

                                <IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/top_page_rank_articles.png"ALIGN=”center” width="650" height="500" />
                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			As a sanity check let's see how well our metric captures the caracteristics of a hub previously described. To do this
			we look at the correlation between the variables Source Count, Target Count, Mean shortest path to articles from article,
			mean shortest path leading to each article and the PageRank score.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/corr_figure.png"ALIGN=”center” width="900" height="300" />
                    	</div>

			<p>
			From the correlation matrix we see that the PageRank score is correlated with both the target count and the source count.
			It is negatively correlated with the mean shortest path to the article and to other articles from a given article.
			This means that the higher the PageRank score the lower is the mean shortest path.
			All correlations are significant using a p-value < 0.01. 
			This tells us the pagerank score captures the characteristics of a hub well!
			Now that we have created a metric for the hubs on wikipedia what categories have the highest pagerank score? The barplot
			below is plotted according to the number of articles in each category on Wikipedia.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/sum_pagerank_hub_score_barchart.png"ALIGN=”center” width="800" height="400" />
                    	</div>

			<p>
			Interestingly, we can see that the category with the highest PageRank score is Geography then Countries followed 
			by Science. This is interesting as this is different from the number of articles in each of these categories. 
			To get a better understanding of the PageRank score we now have a look at the score normalized by the number of articles in each category.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                                <IMG SRC="images/hubs_images/sum_pagerank_hub_score_percent_barchart.png"ALIGN=”center” width="800" height="400" />
                    	</div>
			
			<p>
			From looking at the average PageRank score by category we can see that countries has the high value, which makes sense as among the top 
			10 articles with the highest PageRank score countries make up 5 of these indicating that countries have high scores.
			Zooming back out, lets look at the graph network visualized in space.

                    	</div>


                    <p> 
                    Here we have visualized all the articles in the graph network in space, with each dot representing an article, 
                    and the size of the dot being correlated to the value of the PageRank score. From this, we can get an idea of 
                    just how large the network is, and how there are not many articles with notable PageRank values, meaning they
                    are not very well connected in the network.

                    <p>
                        In our analysis of the Wikispeedia dataset, we previously identified key "hubs" in the network. 
			These hubs often correspond to well known places. 
			    However, the prominence of an article as a hub does not necessarily indicate its alignment with areas of widely shared knowledge. 
			    Instead, to better understand the common knowledge shared among users, we must delve into the paths players take during their games.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Do Players Exhibit Similar Navigation Behavior?</strong><br>
                        To identify shared knowledge, it is essential to determine whether players demonstrate consistent behaviors when faced with the same game setup (i.e., starting and target articles). If players tend to follow similar trajectories, this suggests an underlying common knowledge share by the players.<br>
                        To investigate this, we analyze how different players approach the same game ( same starting point and target) and assess the degree of similarity in the path they take to navigate.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        One way to do so is to look at the distance between paths taken by players for a given game. 
			    There are multiple ways to quantify the "distance" between paths : the Jacquard distance, shortest paths distance or a semantic distance. 
			    Each metric provides a particular perspective on the nature of the similarity. 

                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Here, as an example, we present the results for completed paths in the game that start at "Calculus" and end at "Paul McCartney". 
			    This distance is the cosine distance, ranging from 0 to 2,between the embeddings of two different paths, calculated using a pretrained 
			    BERT model. It represents how semantically close two paths are. <br>
                    </p>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                    </div>

                    	<p>
			The heatmap reveals that the paths taken by different players are highly similar, with a mean semantic distance of 0.21 
			for this specific game. As the histogram demonstrates, this pattern holds true across all completed games in our dataset, 
			showing a global mean distance of 0.15 between two finished paths for the same game. For comparison, we calculated the mean distance 
			between two random paths (based on 100 randomly generated paths), which is significantly higher at 0.87. This indicates that players 
			tend to follow semantically close paths, reflecting similar navigation behaviors.                        
			As we have established that users tend to follow similar patterns, we can now further explore their navigation habits.
			</p>
            
                    	<p>
                        <strong>What do the players' paths teach us about common knowledge?</strong><br>
                        To analyze players' navigation habits, key questions arise: which articles are visited most often? 
			Which categories are explored? What links are clicked on the most? Since players tend to select articles they are 
			familiar with or knowledgeable about to reach their target, examining these choices offers valuable insights into shared 
			knowledge.
			<br>
                        To address this, we identify the top 10 most visited articles, the most frequently clicked links, and the frequency of 
			exploration for each category across all games.
                    	</p>

                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The top 10 most visited articles align closely with the network’s major hubs, representing globally recognized topics. 
			This suggests that players have a good knowledge of these concepts and their connections. Notably, only four categories are 
			represented in the top 10, indicating areas where players feel most confident and knowledgeable.

                        The top 10 most clicked links highlight common associations widely understood by players. As with the most visited articles, these associations are predominantly related to geography and science.
                        This reveals taxonomies that are commonly understood and recognized, such as biodiversity taxonomy (e.g., mammals being animals) and geographic taxonomy (e.g., the UK being part of Europe). These patterns reflect a shared understanding of fundamental classifications that guide players' navigation choices.

                        The word cloud above visualizes the frequency of exploration for each category across all games, with the size of each category proportional to the number of visits it received, normalized by the number of articles within that category. Consistent with earlier observations, the most frequently explored categories are Science, Geography, Countries, and History, highlighting players' stronger knowledge in these domains.Additionally, Everyday Life appears to be another category that players tend to visit more often. In contrast, less visited categories like Mathematics or Art may point to areas where players might have comparatively less familiarity.  </p>

                    <p>
                        To better understand whether players have knowledge of a particular category, it is useful to examine the success rate of games starting from a given category and reaching a target category. This can reveal how confident players are when navigating between different topics.

                    <p>
                        The heatmap above illustrates players' confidence in navigating between different categories. Missing success rates occur due to insufficient data, with too few games played between certain category pairs. The heatmap confirms that players have strong knowledge of countries and geography, as indicated by higher success rates for games targeting articles related to these topics. Surprisingly, we also observe high success rates for certain category pairs, such as IT to Music or Mathematics to People. Additionally, games targeting Religion articles tend to show higher success rates, suggesting new common associations within players' knowledge.<br>
                        These analyses offer valuable insights into players' shared knowledge, but it is also interesting to ask ourselves what players commonly do not know.

                        <strong>What can we learn from unfinished paths?</strong><br>
                        Analyzing successful paths offers valuable insights into shared knowledge, but studying unfinished paths can also uncover crucial information about knowledge gaps. By understanding where players stop and how close they are to the target, we can identify areas where their knowledge is lacking. For instance, players who stop near the target but without a strong semantic connection may not recognize the link between the two points, highlighting a gap in their knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the following plots, we illustrate how close users were to the target, both in terms of semantic distance and the number of clicks away.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/dist_to_target.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>
            
                    <p>
                        As the plots demonstrate, some unfinished games stop very close to the target—either just one click away or semantically close—indicating that players may have thought they had reached the target. However, other games, still fairly close to the end (two or three clicks away), but not semantically close, suggest a potential knowledge gap. In these cases, players may fail to identify the connection between their stopping point and the target.<br>
                        One example from the data involves the target "Milk," where the player stops at "Louis Pasteur," just two clicks away (Louis Pasteur → pasteurization → milk). This suggests that the player may not be aware of the connection between pasteurization and milk.                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        We can further analyze these unfinished games where players are two clicks away from the target by examining the categories of their stopping points and the target categories. To identify patterns in knowledge gaps, we define a "commonly unknown connection" as one where at least 10 players stopped at the same point while attempting to reach the same target. The following plot highlights these commonly unknown connections and the categories they involve.
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The Sankey diagram above visualizes these unknown connections. Interestingly, it includes some categories previously identified as "well-known," such as Science and Geography. This suggests that while players generally possess more knowledge in these areas, they still lack understanding of certain specific topics within these categories. As expected, the diagram also features categories previously labeled as less familiar, such as Everyday Life and Design and Technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the paths taken by players provide valuable insights into common knowledge: they reveal the categories where players have the most familiarity, the links and associations they commonly understand, as well as the connections they often fail to recognize. These findings help us better understand the collective knowledge landscape of the players.  <br>

                        However, it is essential to interpret these results with caution, as they are heavily influenced by the types of games played. The starting and target categories significantly impact the patterns observed, and an unequal distribution of game types could skew the conclusions. Future analyses should aim to account for this bias to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of shared and missing knowledge.

                    <p>
                        Now, let's analyse hubs and player navigation patterns. We aim to combine
                        the two approaches and discuss the findings as a conclusion. We start by analysing the 
                        article usage and then we go on to analysing the overlooked articles, while comparing both analysis 
                        to our measure of 'hubness' - the page rank score.
                    </p>
                    <p>
			In the following four plots we visualize an articles pagerank score against the
                        total number of clicks it has recieved by the players. The goal is to see trends in what articles
                        tends towards the different extremes i.e which articles with a high hub score are not used by players well and what non hubs are 
			often used by players. Since how often players use articles also depends on how often a link is availible
			to players, the y-axis has been normalised by the percentage of articles that has a link to
                        the article in question. In addition, to make it easier to detect outliers, a line is plotted at the 
                        mean of both axises. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The lines divide our plot into 4 quadrants, all of them showing different 
                        extremes and therefore also different information. While most categories 
                        scatter widely across all quadrants, two areas stand out: the upper left 
                        corner and the lower right corner of the plots. <br>

                    In the upper left quadrant, we find articles that are not as connected 
                    to the network as others, yet are still clicked on frequently by players. 
                    One hypothesis as to why this occurs is that these may be topics people 
                    instinctively know. The players may recognize something about the topic 
                    that connects it to the target in some way, even though, on average, it 
                    may be better to choose another path toward a hub. <br>
                        
                    In contrast, the lower right quadrant tells a different story. Here lie articles 
                    that are highly connected yet rarely selected. It could be that these topics are 
                    more specific and slip past everyday curiosity, hinting at lesser-known concepts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, the plots are interactive, so feel free to explore these plots by yourself by removing and singling out categories.
                        Since in this game some players know what kind of articles usually corresponds to a 
                        better path to the target, it is important for the analysis to not focus on specific articles, but instead 
                        on categories of articles that stands out. 
                    </p>

                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/pagerank_vs_frequency.html" width="100%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                    Geography is a scattered category that dominates with some of the largest hubs and frequently 
                    used articles. However, many highly connected articles remain relatively untouched by users, 
                    particularly those focused on countries, which tend heavily toward the lower right quadrant. <br>

                    The Science category tells a similar story, with some of the biggest outliers in both the upper 
                    left and lower right quadrants. <br>

                    Lastly, there is Everyday Life and IT. Articles in this category are generally less connected 
                    than others but are still frequently picked by players. IT stands out in particular, with 
                    no articles appearing in the lower right quadrant. <br>

                    Moving on, some of these findings will be investigated further by looking at the categories 
                    separately and the trends of the second categories related to these articles.   
                    </p>


                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

                    <p>
                        <b>Observations:</b> <br></br>
                        - The categories that have trends towards the upper left quadrant with bigger portion of outliers than other articles are North American Geography, General Geograhpy and Geology and Geophysics. <br></br>
                        - As stated before and can be seen in the first plot, countries constitute the absolute majority of all articles in the lower right quadrant, it can be seen that the countries that one would 
			  usually classify as more "known" have a higher frequency by the players. <br></br>

			The fact that North American Geography tends to the upper left quadrant supports (but does not prove) the claim about the quadrants to some extent, since it can be assumed that people in general 
			have a somewhat good understanding of America and United States compared to other parts of the world, for example countries like Latvia, Laos and Lebanon that can be found in 
			the bottom right quadrant. 

                        It should however be mentioned that 2 of the biggest outliers in the upper left quadrant have "United States" in the article name, the reason for this is probably that 
			the players only selects this article in order to get to the article "United States", hence these articles should not be taken into account when drawing conclusions.

                        <br></br>
                        The categories that tend toward the upper left quadrant, with a larger 
                        portion of outliers than other articles, are North American Geography, General 
                        Geography, and Geology and Geophysics. As noted earlier and seen in the first plot, 
                        countries make up the majority of articles in the lower right quadrant. Countries 
                        that are generally considered more "known" tend to have a higher frequency of clicks 
                        by players.

                        The fact that North American Geography articles appear more frequently in the upper 
                        left quadrant supports, though does not prove, the idea that these articles represent 
                        common knowledge. This may be because people are generally more familiar with the 
                        United States compared to other regions. For example, countries like Latvia, Laos, 
                        and Lebanon are found in the lower right quadrant. However, two of the biggest 
                        outliers in the upper left quadrant include "United States" in their titles, likely 
                        because players select these articles to quickly reach "United States". Therefore, 
                        these articles should not be considered when drawing conclusions.

                        <br></br>

                        Articles with a lower PageRank score but above-average user frequency mostly belong to 
                        the "Film" and "Computer and Video Games" categories. These articles often represent 
                        significant pop-cultural phenomena such as Star Wars, Nintendo, and Mario. Sports 
                        articles make up the largest portion of the lower right quadrant within the "Everyday 
                        Life" category.

                        The prominence of cultural phenomena in the upper left quadrant supports the idea 
                        that these categories are more likely to represent common knowledge than those in 
                        the lower right quadrant. This conclusion can be made because these topics are widely 
                        recognized around the world.

                        Once again, an outlier in the upper left quadrant contains "United States" in the 
                        title, reducing its relevance for analysis. Players likely select this article to reach 
                        "United States," so it does not support claims about common knowledge.

                        The significant presence of sports articles in the lower right quadrant is somewhat 
                        surprising. While articles in the upper left quadrant, such as those about cultural 
                        phenomena, can be assumed to represent common knowledge, sports like volleyball, 
                        badminton, and ice hockey are less intuitive choices. However, some sports articles, 
                        like football, seem out of place in this quadrant. Since there are few major outliers 
                        in the lower right quadrant, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this trend.

                    <p>
                        Chemistry has almost no articles in the upper left quadrant but many in the lower right 
                        quadrant. Physics articles are widely scattered, with those in the upper left quadrant 
                        being primarily space-related, while those in the lower right quadrant cover more 
                        fundamental physics topics. Biology articles are also scattered, with animals mainly 
                        appearing in the upper left quadrant, while more specialized and lower-level biology 
                        articles tend to fall in the lower right quadrant.

                        Once again, the plots reveal trends that align with expectations. Everyday topics such 
                        as animals or well-known space missions like the Moon Landing gravitate toward the upper 
                        left quadrant. In contrast, more academic and specialized articles tend to occupy the 
                        lower right quadrant. This supports the claim that the quadrants reflect a relationship 
                        with common knowledge.

                        In this plot, we gathered external data on the average number of views per month
                        on Wikipedia over the last 10 years for all articles. This data was then used to 
                        calculate the average views of the largest outliers in the quadrants. <br></br>
                        
                        There appears to be a strong correlation between the quadrant in which an outlier 
                        is placed and how often the corresponding article is viewed on Wikipedia. However, 
                        the results may seem counterintuitive at first glance. A natural assumption would 
                        be that articles reflecting common knowledge would have a higher frequency of visits. 
                        The primary counterargument to this assumption is that the number of visits to an 
                        article correlates more strongly with its PageRank score than with user frequency.
                        
                        As shown in earlier analyses, PageRank is correlated with the number of outgoing 
                        links, which in turn reflects the size of the article. Therefore, a higher PageRank 
                        does not necessarily indicate that the topic is more familiar to the general public. 
                        Consequently, the total number of monthly visits is not a reliable indicator of what 
                        constitutes common knowledge and should not be used as a sanity check for our analysis.

                        often players choose to bypass a more central article in favor of a less optimal one, 
                        by comparing their hubness score. 
                        We investigate cases where alternative choices have the same or 
                        shorter shortest-path distance to the target, in order to reveal which articles are 
                        frequently overlooked by players.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <img src="images/DistributionBadChoices.png" alt="Views_quadrant" style="height: 500px;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As expected, users frequently deviate 
                        from the most central navigation path. A remarkable 41.9% of choices are optimal in this context.
                        Notably, some articles are overlooked more frequently 
                        than others, which poses the question if they are less known by the players. The following
                        scatter plot seeks to answer this.
                    </p>


                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/hubscore_vs_forgone.html" width="100%" height="650px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        This plot shows that the more central (higher PageRank) an article is, the more likely 
                        it is to be skipped (with a higher share of being overlooked), even when these articles could lead to 
                        the target just as quickly or faster while being more central to the wikispeedia network 
                        (according to their distance to the target article and their page rank score). 
                        This trend may be due to articles rarely linking to only one hub-like article, 
                        but instead linking to multiple and forcing a choice where the player is unaware of the 
                        exact page rank scores.

                        However, certain patterns emerge when comparing articles with a similar page rank score. 
                        The category countries appears to be generally overlooked less than geography and both less than
                        science. However this metric still does not help in identifying common knowledge, as can be shown
                        with the examplary article 'Wasp' at a page rank score of 0.000092 is overlooked 24.3% of the 
                        time whereas 'George Byron, 6th Baron Byron' at a similar page rank score is merely overlooked 3.9% of the time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <img src="images/hub_usage_plot.png" alt="Views_quadrant" style="height: 500px;">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When analyzing the usage of hubs along navigation paths, it becomes clear that top 
                        hubs are used more frequently at the beginning of a path and less often as users 
                        approach their target. This analysis considers up to ten steps in a player’s path 
                        and displays the average occurrence of a top hub at each path position. The source 
                        and target articles are excluded since they do not involve player choices. The longest
                        shortest path has five path positions and thus three when excluding the source and target article.
                        In 57% of puzzles, the optimal strategy involves selecting one of the top 10% most 
                        connected hubs on the first move. Successful players tend to use these top hubs within 
                        their first three steps more often than unsuccessful players. While this correlation 
                        doesn't imply causation, it highlights navigation patterns between successful and 
                        unsuccessful players.

                        In the end the knowlegde of players is a factor influencing the 
                        players navigation strategies. Yet all knowledge helps a player reach their 
                        wikispeedia target. A players strategies do not discern between very specific
                        knowledge and common knowledge. It can be concluded that the influence of common knowledge cannot 
                        be entirely seperated from other game strategies and behaviours. While common knowledge 
                        is indicated, the extent extent of the common knowledge cannot be seperated.
                        Furthermore, our analyses showed patterns in 
                        player behavior such as a frequent reliance on high-connectivity hubs early in their 
                        paths, which is especially true for successful players. It also shows the tendency of 
                        players to frequently bypass the most central articles while navigating
                        to the target, choosing a less-linked potentially more intuitive article as the next step.

                <p>In conclusion, the analysis of hubs and user navigation patterns provides indications
                        of shared knowledge and common navigation behaviors. By examining the paths players take, 
                        the articles they visit most frequently, and the categories they explore, we gain a deeper 
                        understanding of the collective knowledge landscape. Additionally, the investigation of 
                        bypassed articles provides insights into the choices players make during navigation, 
                        highlighting topics that are consistently overlooked. These findings offer valuable 
                        insights into the common knowledge shared by players and the navigation strategies they employ.
