                <p>Our project uses Wikispeedia to explore the structure and gaps in our society's "common knowledge" by analyzing both popular articles and hub articles. We aim to understand which subjects are most commonly recognized, how players navigate between them, and where knowledge gaps may exist. By identifying highly visited articles and hubs (articles with many links) - we can analyze popular knowledge compared to specialized knowledge. Additionally, exploring common links in successful paths with unfinished paths will further help us understand public knowledge gaps. Finally, we compare hubs and user navigation patterns to determine whether hubs improve path efficiency or if users bypass them in favor of more accessible articles. Through these analyses, we hope to reveal insights into shared knowledge, intuitive navigation patterns, and the cultural biases embedded in these patterns.</p>

                    <p>
                        In our analysis of the Wikispeedia dataset, we previously identified key "hubs" in the network. These hubs often correspond to culturally significant anchor points, reflecting the structure of modern knowledge. However, the prominence of an article as a hub does not necessarily indicate its alignment with areas of widely shared knowledge. Instead, to better understand the common knowledge shared among users, we must delve into the paths players take during their games.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Do Players Exhibit Similar Navigation Behavior?</strong><br>
                        To identify shared knowledge, it is essential to determine whether players demonstrate consistent behaviors when faced with the same game setup (i.e., starting and target articles). If players tend to follow similar trajectories, this suggests an underlying consensus or shared understanding of how knowledge is structured within Wikipedia.<br>
                        To investigate this, we analyze how different players approach the same game (with the same starting point and target) and assess the degree of similarity in the path they take to navigate.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        One way to do so is to look at the distance between paths taken by players for a given game. There are multiple ways to quantify the "distance" between paths: the Jacquard distance, shortest paths distance, or a semantic distance. Each metric provides a particular perspective on the nature of the similarity.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        Here as an example, we display the results for finished paths of the game starting at "Calculus" and reaching "Paul McCartney", using a semantic distance based on BERT embeddings.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As shown in the graph, the paths are semantically close to one another, indicating that users exhibit similar navigation behaviors.
                    </p>
            
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <iframe src="images/heatmap_distance.html" style="width: 80%; height: 650px; border: none;"></iframe>
                    </div>                    

                    <p>
                        Having established that users tend to follow similar patterns, we can further explore their navigation habits: which articles do they visit most frequently? Which categories do they explore? What links do they click on? Since players typically choose articles they are familiar with or have knowledge about in order to reach their target, analyzing these choices will provide valuable insights into shared knowledge.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        <strong>What do the players' paths teach us about common knowledge?</strong><br>
                        From all the players' paths in the data (finished and unfinished paths), we can have access to the top 10 most visited articles, top 10 most clicked links, and show how frequently each category is visited.<br>
                        <strong>#Analysis</strong><br>
                        Another interesting indicator is to look at the top 10 articles, categories, and links.<br>
                        <strong>#Figures:</strong> top 10 articles, categories, links<br>
                        Links of length 3 (?)

                    <p>
                        However, looking at unfinished paths in abandoned games can also be very meaningful in order to understand lack of knowledge. One very interesting aspect is to look at where the user stopped and how close they were to the target. We show in the following plots how close users were from the target in terms of semantic distance and in terms of number of clicks away.<br>
                        Some of these unfinished games stop very close to the target (one click away or really semantically close); we could consider that these games stopped because players thought they had reached the target. However, some of these games, which are still pretty close to the end (two or three clicks away) and not so semantically close, provide evidence of some lack of knowledge: people may not be aware of what their stop point and their target point have in common.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        One example: The target to reach is Milk, and the person stopped at Louis Pasteur, which is only two clicks away: Louis Pasteur → pasteurization → milk.<br>
                        It indicates that this person might not be aware of what pasteurization is and that it does concern milk.
                    </p>
