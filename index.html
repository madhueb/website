                    <p>Wikispeedia is a game that was developed by the Laboratory for Web Algorithmics of the Università degli Studi di Milano. The game consists of a series of questions that are asked to the player, who has to answer them by selecting the correct answer from a list of possible answers. The questions are related to a wide range of topics, such as history, geography, science, and popular culture. The game is designed to be fun and educational, and it is suitable for players of all ages. In this project, we will analyze the data collected from the game in order to gain insights into the common knowledge of the players. We will explore the types of questions that are asked in the game, the difficulty of the questions, and the performance of the players. We will also investigate how the players' knowledge varies depending on their age
